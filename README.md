# voice command recognition in Spanish for handicapped restrooms
An audio dataset was created for pseudo speech recognition in Spanish, specifically for 7 voice commands "ENCENDER", "APAGAR", "0", "25", "50", "75" and "100", these audios were recorded by 9 men and 5 women with a total of 851 .wav files with noise recount processing in the frequency domain and clipped in the time domain.

In addition, audios of typical stationary noises in a bathroom were recorded, as well as the noise of an exhaust fan, a heater or the water in the shower.
